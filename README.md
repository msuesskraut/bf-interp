# bf-interp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/msuesskraut/bf-interp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/msuesskraut/bf-interp)

A brainfuck interpreter in Rust.
Its main purpose is to learn some Rust.

Start it with `cargo run`.
It will execute the `mandelbrot.bf` program from the `examples` directory.
The program prints the Mandelbrot picture in ASCII on the screen.

Further optimizations will follow.
